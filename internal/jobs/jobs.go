	// provided on your job arguments struct. Jobs are identified by a string
	// instead of being based on type names so that previously inserted jobs
	// can be worked across deploys even if job/worker types are renamed.
	//
	// Kinds should be formatted without spaces like `my_custom_job`,
	// `mycustomjob`, or `my-custom-job`. Many special characters like colons,
	// dots, hyphens, and underscores are allowed, but those like spaces and
	// commas, which would interfere with UI functionality, are invalid.
	//
	// After initially deploying a job, it's generally not safe to rename its
	// kind (unless the database is completely empty) because River won't know
	// which worker should work the old kind. Job kinds can be renamed safely
	// over multiple deploys using the JobArgsWithKindAliases interface.
